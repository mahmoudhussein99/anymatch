Experiment to leave the wdc-computers dataset out with attr+row as training data.
The model will be trained on the mixture of attribute and row level data.
The training set size of wdc-shoes is larger than 1200, we will do down-sampling with automl_filter to maximally 1200 pairs.
The training set size of wdc-watches is larger than 1200, we will do down-sampling with automl_filter to maximally 1200 pairs.
The training set size of wdc-cameras is larger than 1200, we will do down-sampling with automl_filter to maximally 1200 pairs.
The training set size of dbgo is larger than 1200, we will do down-sampling with automl_filter to maximally 1200 pairs.
The training set size of music is larger than 1200, we will do down-sampling with automl_filter to maximally 1200 pairs.
